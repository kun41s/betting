// Contract Guidelines

- Deploy State
    - match is not started so isStarted is false
    - match is not ended so isEnded is false
    - total betters is 0
    - we can add betters before match starts

Steps to follow
1. Before match starts we can add betters
    
    Better Address                                  team            amount to enroll
    0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2      India           1 ETHER    
    0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db      India           1 ETHER
    0x78731D3Ca6b7E34aC0F824c42a7cC18A495cabaB      Australia       1 ETHER    
    0x617F2E2fD72FD9D5503197092aC168c91465E7f2      Australia       1 ETHER
    0x17F6AD8Ef982297579C203069C1DbfFE4348c372      India           1 ETHER

    - now we can check total players using getPlayers function


2. call startMatch function to start match
    - now betters cannot enroll to bet
    - isStarted is converted to true

3. Now let's end match using endMatch function
    - as we already initialize our winning team is India
    - So from total betters whoever choosen there team as India can get the winning amount
    - total amount = 5 players * 1 ethers    //i.e 5 ethers
    - amount per winner = total amount / totalWinners  //i.e  5 ethers / 3  = 1.666666667 ethers

//Changes can occur with API
[
    1. Nobody is owner
    2. Match is starting from data
    3. After match ends, All the betters who bet on winning team get rewarded as winning amount.
